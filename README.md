#### Application-04

**1.** A **repository** is like a folder where we can store  all the files, projects and can track the history of the file. We can discuss and manage our project's work by owner or whoever has the access to the repository by simply sharing ownership of repositories with other people in an organization. The repo introduces the `ggimage package`, which allows embedding images when drawing ggplot2 and supports aes mapping, which maps discrete variables to different images. Here, ggimage is used to display applications in these specific fields. The design of ggimage is universal and is not limited by specific scenes.

   + I first collaborated on repo name by accepting the invitation  [**application04-annie5696**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696)  
   + On the first Landing pages of the repo, we can see the primary repo name on left top or in the URL after "/" ([github.com/**sta518**](https://github.com/sta518)), which has collection of all other reposiory. Under this, my repo is ([github.com/sta518/**application04-annie5696**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696))
   + Under this file, options like how many commit, branch and who have the access to this repo ( _contributer's information_) are stored on top of the table. Below the orange line, informations like upload, finding any files, clone etc are available. The following process can be accessed through this repo which are explained below.
   
   |`Name`                          |`Description`                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------|
|1. [**application-04.Rmd**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/Application-04.Rmd) | We can see the embedded R code chunks that can be run, and allows output to be included in the document.|
|1. [**application-04.md**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/Application-04.md) | Knitted document for Rmd file.|
|2. [**README.html**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/README.html)                | Self build html file, which automatically generates html code whatever we type in `.Rmd file`|
|3. [**README.md**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/README.md) | I have written all this information.|
|4. [**application-04.html**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/Application-04.html) | similar to `README.html`. |
|5. [**application-04-instructions.md**](https://github.com/sta518/application04-annie5696/blob/master/application04-instructions.md) | Information of the workflow|
